THE PRAYER OF 69TH JAVANEIN DAY

DUY may you bless,
us those who pray.
Keep coming less,
the sin you prey.

Ever since the begining,
DUY had always been helping.
And therefore we are seeing,
beatiful world he's building.

And one day we will see,
beyond the waves of sea,
the heaven where stands he.

An end once upon land,
the greatest act is planned,
end of sin will be grand.
