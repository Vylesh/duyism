			The Bhain't
		The origin of Pirata Stupidae Bhaia
	the bhae (also known as bhais) are species of Pirata Stupidae.
The commonly used indian word by bhais became synonymous with bhae.
These species were thought that they became extinct during end of 19th or start 20th century,
then, not so long after duyy Duy's reapperance, it was shown that truth is contrary.
To this day "Pirata Stupidae bhaia" remain as most dominant Pirata subdivision.
That means term bhai/bhae/bhaia meaning "stupid pirate" became expectation,
thenceforth I will call these just bhai or bhae, for simplification.
		So what are bhae?
	Since emergement of bhae from pure stupidity,
selected behaviours seemed to became bhae normality.
So for example bhai would, in holy duylands especially,
scream about lag, heat, support, cringe or similiar insanity.
Since bhae belong to Pirata (stupidae) species family,
supermajority of bhae also like to do piracy.
		How to prevent bhae?
	Hell of duyism is the answer expectation,
hence all bhae are left with no immidiate solution.
Hence we should punish them to prevent this?
Howerer act of that would result in crisis,
hence better solution is to try teach them ways of duyism,
henceforth we should not kill on sight anyone commiting bhaism,
howerer we should commit to them life long duyism checking,
hence they will not be piracy doing.
		Etc
	Estimates show that there is extra stupid bhae population percentange.
Exterminate these on sight of their's garbage.
Examples of such behaviour are nfa, sfa and scamming,
end quickly theirs attempt at bhaism enlarging.
		Note
	Nothing in this document does imply murder.
Nothing but needed duyism rule them over.
